#Accessibility Report
##Universal Design Principles
###Principle 1: Equitable Use
- The project does not have a feature for equitable use as it primarily only focuses on groups of people that can easily read. 
- Some features that can be implemented for equitable use is a feature to increase text and as well implementing keyboard navigation. This can increase equitable use as now groups of people with limited mobility and sight can be able to easily use the project.

###Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- The project does not have flexibility in use.
- Some features that can be implemented is language translation for people who has another native language that is not English. Another feature can be light and dark mode for ease of viewing.
  
###Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- The project's homepage displays all actions through easy visual icons that can be easily clicked by the user (see resources folder).
- Thus, any user, regardless of disability, can be able to use the project without requiring any manual.

###Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- The principle does not apply to this project as many formats of information can not be done in this project.
- Specifically, the project deals with information in forms of recipes, including instructions and nutritional information. There can not be any kind of format done for them other than its standard versions.
- In fact, adjusting the standard versions of how recipe and nutritional information is displayed can make it more inaccessible, as many users would require a manual/guide to understand.
  
###Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- A feature that upholds this principle is the window that confirms wheter the user has successfully saved the recipe or not to its collection.
- If the recipe has already been saved, a pop-up window will indicate that it is already saved, minimizing error for a recipe to be saved another time.
- The confirmation pop-up window (if it was saved successfully) allows the user to know that it has been saved and they do not need to save it again.
  
###Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- The project does not have this feature as it requires specific informaton from the user, which creates high physical effort.
- Specifically, in order for the user to filter for recipes they want, they need to click many buttons regarding dietary restrictions and type in key words. This is physically streneous and can not be adjusted as those specifics from the user are required for the project to effectively filter for the desired recipes.
  
###Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- The project does not have this principle.
- The project can implement features regarding large buttons and bigger text when reading recipes to ensure that all groups of users can comfortably read and use the project.
 
##Who We Are Marketing the Program 
The program is marketed towards young professionals, typically between 20-27, who are either still in university or early in their careers. This is because this demographic is more likely to have less time to cook, and would desire a meal-planning program that allows them to have the convinence of planning out healthy meals (instead of relying on take-out). Demographics include busy students, young professionals working such as engineers and investment bankers, and people living busy lives in cities with limited access to grocery stores. As well, this includes all people of ethnicities, religions, health issues, and dietary restrictions, as the project accomodates for those by implementing recipe filters such as halal, gluten-free, and vegan. 

##Likeliness of Other Groups Using the Program
The program would not be likely used by other demographics such as the eldery and people who have visual impairments. The project does not have features that accomodate to them, and will likely exclude them. The program assumes that the user is physically able to read and use the mouse with ease, and this unfortunately many demographics that require accessibility features.
